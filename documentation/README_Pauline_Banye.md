> # Project Description
[Ersilia Open Source Initiative](https://ersilia.io) is a nonprofit organisation that is focused on the research into infectious diseases. We intend to fast-track the development of new medicines by utilizing artificial intelligence tools.

The [Ersilia Model Hub](https://airtable.com/shrUcrUnd7jB9ChZV) is the key project of the Ersilia Open Source Initiative. It is a free repository which contains Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) models. The aim is to provide user friendly models to scientists to aid their research and predict outcomes easily without requiring complex coding abilities.

<p align='justify'>
Currently, majority of the developed tools, including published and open-sourced, remain unusable to a vast majority of the scientific community who lack the necessary expertise. This is problematic especially in Low and Middle Income Country institutions with limited access to bioinformatic facilities or data science experts. This project aims to provide access to this expertise and support research into a variety of neglected and infectious diseases.

<p align='justify'>
The models embedded in the hub include established models as well as propriety models developed by the Ersilia team.

| <b>Attributes</b>     | <b>Description</b>           
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------- |
| **`Open Source`** |All the Ersilia assets are released under the MIT license. This enables the scientific community to review, contribute and improve our code. The advantage is the development of tools which have been validated more extensively than in the usual peer-review system. |
| **`User friendly`**|Our tools are designed with scientists without complex coding expertise in mind, thus they are beginner friendly. Anyone can browse and make a choice from the collection of models based on their research interest and run predictions with ease.  |
| **`Bioactivity Signatures`**|The models available in the hub are built upon a rich representation of molecules consisting of extensive experimental data including targets and side effect profiles, resulting in more clinically relevant and powerful predictions. |
| **`Data driven`**|Ersilia technology achieves a state-of-the-art performance due to the integration of chemical, genomic and biomedical text data. Our AI tools are extensively trained using millions of data from scientific literature.|

> ## Installation on MacOSX or Linux
The steps for installing this project on a Linux or MacOSX are as follows: 

- First install Python 3.7 upwards from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/) to your local device

- Install Conda environments, either [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), for handling dependencies effectively. 
```
# to create a conda environment
$ conda create -n ersilia python=3.7

# to activate the environment
$ conda activate ersilia
```
Detailed instructions for setting up the conda environment can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). This  ensures that all the AI/ML models will work seamlessly on your local device.
```
# Install Docker
$ sudo apt install docker.io

# Install dependencies
$ sudo snap install docker

# Check the version to confirm Docker was installed
$ docker --version
```

- Install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/installation), a free and open source tool that brings GitHub to your terminal. 
```
# To install the Git CLI
$ conda install gh -c conda-forge

# Log in to GitHub and follow the required steps
$ gh auth login
```
- Some models with with large parameters require [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (Git LFS) to function properly.
```
# Install Git LFS
$ conda install git-lfs -c conda-forge

# Activate Git LFS
$ git-lfs install
``` 

#
> ## Installation on Windows
The Elrisia tool was optimized for a system with Ubuntu OS. For installation on a windows system, we recommend that Ubuntu is installed. This can be done very easily using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).


WSL is a free, optional feature of Windows 10 that allows Linux programs to run on Windows. 

- To install WSL, run Command Prompt as Administrator, then type the following command.
```
$ wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```
- Once the Ubuntu terminal is up and running, you'll be prompted to create a default UNIX user account. Input a username and password.

- Next download anaconda or miniconda. 

`Note*`

The installation steps outlined below were performed with Anaconda v5.3.1

```
wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
- Run the Anaconda installation script

```
bash Anaconda3-5.3.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
- Follow the prompts and accept the license agreement.

`Note*` 

Confirm that Anaconda and Python were installed by running `'which python'` in the terminal, you should see a path to your installation i.e. `/home/pauline/anaconda3/bin/python`.

Once Anaconda is successfully installed, proceed with the steps to activate the ersilia conda environment. 

```
$ conda create -n ersilia python=3.7

# to activate the environment
$ conda activate ersilia
```
Then follow all the remaining  steps outlined in the [Installation on MacOSX or Linux](#installation-on-macosx-or-linux) section

Once Ersilia is successfully installed, you can search for your AI/ML models of interest in the [Ersilia Model Hub](https://airtable.com/shrXfZ8pqro0jjcsG/tblZGe2a2XeBxrEHP/viwd5XJVLslkE11Tg). All available models are accessible through the [Ersilia Python package](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia). 

`Note*`

You need to use your linux terminal with the activated ersilia environment to run these commands.

> ## Usage Steps
- First fetch the model of interest:
```
# fetch model
$ ersilia fetch -v <name-of-model>

or

# fetch model using the verbose mode for debugging
$ ersilia fetch -v <name-of-model>
```
- Generate some example molecules, to be used as input:
```
$ ersilia example <name-of-model> -n 5 -f my_molecules.csv
```

- Serve your model:
```
$ ersilia serve <name-of-model>
```
- Run the prediction API:
```
$ ersilia api -i my_molecules.csv -o my_predictions.csv
```
- Finally, close the service when you are done.
